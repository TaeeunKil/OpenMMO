//! Solid-furniture collision — the authoritative footprint table + geometry
//! shared by every client that enforces movement:
//! - the browser (via the `passability_*` wasm exports),
//! - the native agent-client (bots), and
//! - the server (later, for validating client movement / catching cheats).
//!
//! Editor-placed furniture is a runtime-loaded analogue of dungeon props: where
//! `dungeon::floor_passability_cells_inner` seals a prop's cell with `EDGE_ALL`
//! at generation time, here we seal a placed furniture piece's footprint cells
//! at load time. Keeping the footprint table and rasterisation in shared Rust
//! (rather than deriving it from meshes at runtime) is what lets all three
//! callers agree on the exact same solid cells — a prerequisite for the server
//! trusting the client's position.
